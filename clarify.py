CLARITY_LLM_JUDGE_PROMPT = """
In this task, you will be presented with a query and an answer. Your objective is to evaluate the clarity 
of the answer in addressing the query. A clear response is one that is precise, coherent, and directly 
addresses the query without introducing unnecessary complexity or ambiguity. An unclear response is one 
that is vague, disorganized, or difficult to understand, even if it may be factually correct.

Your response should be a single word: either "clear" or "unclear," and it should not include any other 
text or characters. "clear" indicates that the answer is well-structured, easy to understand, and 
appropriately addresses the query. "unclear" indicates that some part of the response could be better 
structured or worded.
Please carefully consider the query and answer before determining your response.

After analyzing the query and the answer, you must write a detailed explanation of your reasoning to 
justify why you chose either "clear" or "unclear." Avoid stating the final label at the beginning of your 
explanation. Your reasoning should include specific points about how the answer does or does not meet the 
criteria for clarity.
