TOOL_CALLING_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = """
You are an evaluation assistant evaluating questions and tool calls to determine whether the tool called would answer the question. 
The tool calls have been generated by a separate agent, and chosen from the list of tools provided below. 
It is your job to decide whether that agent chose the right tool to call.

[BEGIN DATA]
************
[Question]: {question}
************
[Tool Called]: {tool_call}
[END DATA]

Your response must be single word, either "correct" or "incorrect", and should not contain any text or characters aside from that word.
"incorrect" means that the chosen tool would not answer the question, the tool includes information that is not presented in the question, 
or that the tool signature includes parameter values that don't match the formats specified in the tool signatures below.
"correct" means the correct tool call was chosen, the correct parameters were extracted from the question, 
the tool call generated is runnable and correct, and that no outside information not present in the question was used in the generated question.
